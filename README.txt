               UFW FIREWALL CONFIGURATION ON KALI LINUX
================================================================================

REPOSITORY OVERVIEW
-------------------
This repository documents the complete configuration and implementation of UFW 
(Uncomplicated Firewall) on Kali Linux. It serves as a comprehensive guide for 
setting up and managing firewall rules to secure network access on penetration 
testing and security-focused Linux distributions.


ABOUT UFW FIREWALL
------------------
UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) is a user-friendly command-line interface for 
managing iptables firewall rules on Linux systems. It simplifies the complex 
process of configuring network security policies, making it accessible for both 
beginners and experienced administrators.

Why Use UFW on Kali Linux?
- Simplifies firewall management compared to raw iptables commands
- Provides essential security layer for penetration testing environments
- Allows precise control over inbound/outbound network traffic
- Helps prevent unauthorized access while maintaining necessary services
- Essential for securing SSH and other critical network services


REPOSITORY CONTENTS
-------------------
This repository contains step-by-step visual documentation of the entire UFW 
configuration process, along with a detailed PDF report summarizing the setup.


IMAGES FOLDER - STEP-BY-STEP SCREENSHOTS

USAGE TIPS FOR NEW USERS
-------------------------
1. Review the images in chronological order (1-5) to understand the setup flow
2. Read the PDF report for detailed context and command explanations
3. Use this repository as a reference when configuring UFW on your own system
4. Always test firewall rules after configuration to ensure proper functionality
5. Remember to allow SSH before enabling UFW to avoid losing remote access
6. Use 'sudo ufw status verbose' to review your current firewall configuration


KEY COMMANDS COVERED

- sudo ufw enable          : Activate the firewall
- sudo ufw status verbose  : Check detailed firewall status
- sudo ufw allow 22        : Allow SSH connections
- sudo ufw deny 23         : Deny Telnet connections
- ssh user@hostname        : Test SSH connectivity
- telnet hostname 23       : Test blocked port access
